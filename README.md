# Hi, Joel!

Just wanted to take a quick peak at the data you were looking and and get an idea of what might be involved and of interest.  The quick bit of code I wrote can be found [here](https://github.com/cj2001/for_joel_gratz/blob/master/gfs_demo.ipynb).  Note that this view of the code (i.e. looking at it on GitHub rather than running it on your computer) will not render it properly.

Please let me know if you have any thought / comments / concerns / questions / etc.

Thanks!
