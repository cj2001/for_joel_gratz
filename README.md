# Hi, Joel!

Just wanted to take a quick peak at the data you were looking and and get an idea of what might be involved and of interest.  The quick bit of code I wrote can be found [here](https://github.com/cj2001/for_joel_gratz/blob/master/gfs_demo.ipynb).  Note that this view of the code (i.e. looking at it on GitHub rather than running it on your computer) will not render it properly.  So I took a screen grab of the output:

Please let me know if you have any thought / comments / concerns / questions / etc.

Thanks!
